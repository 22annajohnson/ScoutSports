# Scout Design System

## Purpose

This document defines the starting point for Scout's design system. It should help future feature plans and implementation tickets preserve a consistent product experience across iOS today and web later.

This is planning documentation, not a final design spec.

## Design Principles

- Support fast real-world action. Interfaces should help users discover, decide, and coordinate quickly.
- Make sports context scannable. Skill level, sport, location, availability, and play intent should be easy to understand.
- Build trust through clarity. Profiles, matches, and event participation should communicate enough context for confident decisions.
- Stay warm but practical. Scout should feel social and energetic without becoming visually noisy.
- Preserve platform expectations. iOS should feel native; future web should feel consistent without copying iOS controls blindly.

## Current iOS Design Areas

The current iOS app has design-related structure in:

- `Scout/Design/Assets.xcassets`
- `Scout/Design/Components`
- `Scout/Design/Modifiers`
- `Scout/Design/Preview`
- `Scout/Design/Theme`
- `Scout/Design/Typography`

Future design work should inspect these areas before adding new components, modifiers, colors, or typography styles.

## Visual Language

### Color

Document approved semantic colors rather than one-off usage. Future tokens should distinguish roles such as:

- Background
- Surface
- Primary action
- Secondary action
- Text primary
- Text secondary
- Border
- Error
- Success
- Sport or skill indicators

### Typography

Typography should prioritize scanability on mobile:

- Large titles for screen identity.
- Section headings for grouping.
- Body text for profile and event details.
- Captions for metadata and secondary context.
- Button labels that remain short and action-oriented.

### Spacing and Layout

Layout should support repeated use and mobile ergonomics:

- Consistent vertical rhythm.
- Clear separation between profile sections.
- Stable card dimensions where swipe or feed content changes dynamically.
- Avoid layouts that jump when async data loads.

### Motion

Motion should clarify state changes and social feedback:

- Swipe decisions.
- Match confirmation.
- Loading transitions.
- Error recovery.

Motion should not block core tasks.

### Motion and State Patterns

Motion should communicate state, reinforce user intent, and follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines as the iOS baseline. Custom motion patterns should be documented in an approved design plan before implementation.

Operational expectations:

- Use motion to clarify cause and effect, such as a swipe decision, save confirmation, match reveal, or event participation change.
- Keep motion short enough that it does not delay the next user action.
- Use consistent motion for similar state changes across Profile, Swipe, Feed, Events, Chat, Maps, and Notifications.
- Respect Reduced Motion. Essential state changes must remain understandable without animation.
- Do not rely on motion alone to communicate success, error, or completion.

Shared state expectations:

| State | Expected Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Loading | Preserve layout stability where possible, communicate that work is in progress, and avoid blocking unrelated actions. |
| Empty | Explain why there is no content and provide a useful next action or education path. |
| Error | Explain what happened in user-facing language and provide a recovery path such as retry, edit, dismiss, or contact support. |
| Success | Confirm completion without trapping the user or interrupting the next likely action. |
| Recovery | Keep the user oriented, preserve entered data where possible, and make the next safe action clear. |

UI tickets and PRs that affect motion or state handling should document the loading, empty, error, success, recovery, accessibility, and Reduced Motion implications.

## Component Families

Initial component families to document and standardize:

- Buttons and icon buttons.
- Form fields and pickers.
- Profile field rows.
- Profile photo and media components.
- Sport and skill badges.
- Swipe cards.
- Match modal.
- Empty states.
- Loading states.
- Error states.
- Event cards and attendance controls.

New components should be added only when existing components cannot be extended cleanly.

## Interaction Patterns

### Onboarding

Onboarding should request only the information needed to make first discovery useful.

### Profile Editing

Profile editing should make required and optional fields clear, preserve user input, and provide visible save/error feedback.

### Swipe and Discovery

Swipe interactions should provide enough context before decisions and should recover gracefully from empty decks, load failures, and accidental actions where supported.

### Events

Events should make time, location, skill expectations, capacity, and participation state clear before a user joins.

## Accessibility

Design and implementation should account for:

- Dynamic Type.
- VoiceOver labels and reading order.
- Sufficient color contrast.
- Touch target sizes.
- Reduced motion.
- Error states that do not rely on color alone.

## Platform Considerations

iOS and web should share product concepts, language, and visual identity, but each platform should use native interaction expectations. Shared design tokens may be proposed later, but require explicit approval before implementation.

## Open Design Questions

- What are Scout's approved semantic color tokens?
- What typography scale should be shared across product surfaces?
- Which components must exist before web migration?
- How should sport-specific visuals scale beyond pickleball?
- What match and event feedback patterns are core to the brand?
